Overview: 

1. "DataVAR.xlsx" contains the macroeconomic data for Argentina from 1900 to 2015, as well as the Grilli-Yang commodity price index.
   This data is described and analyzed in the Section 2 of the paper. 
   It is also used for estimating the structural model (see #3 below).
 
2. Replication files to solve the calibrated version of the model presented in Section 3 of the paper.
   This contains a Dynare .mod file as well as a file that calculates the steady state of the model.

3. Replication files to estimate the model, as shown in Section 5 of the paper.
   This again contains a Dynare .mod and steady state file.
   It is also contains a data file, which is the same data as in #1, but transformed according to the measurement equations.
